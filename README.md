### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

I'm a senior front-end developer with over 7 years of experience in building web applications using modern technologies and frameworks. 

I'm passionate about creating user-friendly, responsive, and accessible websites that deliver value to the end-users and the business.

I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. I enjoy reading tech articles with morning coffee. I plan on creating my own blog where I can share what I have learned with a broader audience (do not worry, it is not going to be on Medium).

Most of the projects you will see here are ones that I am experimenting with different technology or architecture, they are mostly my playground and should treated as such.

Do note that some of them may be **outdated**.


### ðŸ”­ What I am currently working on

I want to get a little better with different frameworks on the front end, so I am not locked with React all the time. 

I am also exploring the back-end as well, currently with NodeJS+ExpressJS, but I would like to test things out with Python/.Net in the future.
